```

## Prettier and Eslint

## Commit

We use the best practices for message's commit, using [Commit lint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) and [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#making-your-repo-commitizen-friendly) we can generate changelogs automatically.

Run `npm run commit` and commitizen will help you.
